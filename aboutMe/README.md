Hello! Welcome to my personal page.

## About Me
I'm a third year junior student studying in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I moved from Shanghai, China to Seattle, US in September 2016. Since then, I've dedicating my whole time in exploring Computer Science. I just finished EE 469 and EE 371 last quarter, and is planning to graduate on 2024 spring since my capstone is on 2024 winter and spring. Please let me know if you got any questions you have about me, and welcome to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/bonie-wang).

## Hobbies
1. I am big fan of soccer and premier league, especially team Chelsea F.C (which is a English professional football club based in Fulham, west London. We just got champion in 2021 UEFA Champion league, however due to multiple reason, our team is having a really hard time now (we are now place 10 in the league). Please show some support if you can. :soccer:
2. I was a team member of my high school's boy swim & dive team. In addition, I was also a member of King club and Issaquah Swim & dive team the whole time during my high school. Even though I quit the team after going to college, I still take time to swim whenever I have time during University at IMA. :swimmer:
3. I also take time to play video games, the one I play the most is League of Legends (since a lot of my friends are also playing this game). :collision:

## Experience
- During last summer, I joined the SEALS automation lab working on providing services to UW medicine. However, after staying there for 4 months, I decided that I wasn't for the job and quit the lab.
- Currently, I'm working on findin interns(However, it's been really hard to find intern this year since most of the high tech companies are cutting their budget and firing people) :persevere:
