Hello! Welcome to my personal page.

## About Me
I'm a third year junior student studying in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I moved from Shanghai, China to Seattle, US in September 2016. Since then, I've dedicating my whole time in exploring Computer Science. I just finished EE 469 and EE 371 last quarter, and is planning to graduate on 2024 spring since my capstone is on 2024 winter and spring. Please let me know if you got any questions you have about me, and welcome to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/bonie-wang).
